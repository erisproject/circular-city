circular-city
=============

A "circular city" model: a large number of uniformly spaced agents living on a
circle, who buy from firms who position themselves on the circle.  This is
essentially a Hotelling model adapted to have no endpoint.

Firms have two choice dimensions: position, and price.  All firms sell
identical goods, but households incur a cost of obtaining the good based on the
distance to the firm, plus the firm's price.  Thus firms still have some market
power: they can charge a higher price when no other firm is nearby.
